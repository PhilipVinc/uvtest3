# NetKet Pro: Internal NetKetâ„¢ codes of the Quantum AI Group in Ecole Polytechnique

NetKet pro is the collection of codes developed by the group working on Neural-Network
methods for Quantum Many Body Physics (and beyond) at Ecole Polytechnique, in Paris/Saclay.

This code is not public, even though this documentation might be, for our own ease. 
It includes stuff we are working on, we worked on and we are experimenting with. 
Some of this might end up in NetKet one day, most of it won't.
If you see something you're interested in, get in touch.

In general this repository requires the latest release of NetKet, if not a recent commit from the master branch.

Those are tools that can be used to run algorithms/research.

Here we have the updated version of MCState, with some additional methods related to 
sampling other distributions.
This also includes utilities to hack new functionalities onto NetKet (called monkeypatching).

There is also a side package that reimplements the drivers while allowing for checkpointing.
